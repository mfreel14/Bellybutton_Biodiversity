# Bellybutton_Biodiversity

The completed dashboard has a panel for demographic information and visualizes bacterial data for each volunteer.Â  Through the dashboard you can identify the top 10 bacterial species in belly buttons. That way, if the company has a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
